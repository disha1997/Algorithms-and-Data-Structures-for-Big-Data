Problem:
Professor Diogenes has supposedly identical VLSI chips that in principle are capable of testing each other. The professor’s test jig accommodates two chips at a time. When the jig is loaded, each chip tests the other and reports whether it is good or bad. A good chip always reports accurately whether the other chip is good or bad, but the answer of a bad chip cannot be trusted. Thus, the four possible outcomes of a test are as follows:
Chip A says Chip B Says Conclusion
-------------- ---------------- ---------------------------------
B is good | A is good   | both are good, or both are bad
B is good | A is bad    | at least one is bad
B is bad  | A is good    | at least one is bad
B is bad  | A is bad     | at least one is bad
 
a) Consider the problem of finding a single good chip from among n chips, assuming that more than n/2 of the chips are good. Show that [n/2] pairwise tests are sufficient to reduce the problem to one of nearly half the size.
b) Show that the good chips can be identified with O(n) (proportional to n) pairwise tests, assuming that more than n/2 of the chips are good. Give and solve the recurrence that describes the number of tests.
